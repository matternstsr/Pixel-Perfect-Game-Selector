# **Pixel Perfect Game Selector** 

## Introduction
This README is for the Hack Sprint in T2 at Atlas.
We decided to create a web quiz for our project based on the theme of this year.
The web quiz is used to match you to a new game to try!

## About the Developer

Hello! I'm [Matthew Ernst](https://matternst.com/), a passionate software developer with a love for creating interactive applications. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/MatthewErn46471)  or check out my work in my [Portfolio Project repository](https://github.com/matternstsr).

## Overview
The idea for our web quiz originated from our shared love for gaming and the desire to create something that resonates with fellow gamers. We wanted to capture the spirit of winter while making the experience fun and engaging. Collaborating with my team, we focused on creating a user-friendly interface that not only aligns with our theme but also provides a seamless experience.
Challenges Faced

## Project Story
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that our application functioned smoothly across different browsers and devices. We also had to navigate API integrations carefully to fetch game data based on user inputs without any hiccups. Despite these challenges, the thrill of seeing our project come together made the effort worthwhile!

### Requirements
- Must match the theme.
- Theme is: Winter.
- Project must be one of the following: Single Page website, terminal application, a small game.
- Project must be publicly accessible.
- Group must make a 5 minute presentation on project.

### Instructions
- Follow the link to the website : http://storage.googleapis.com/pixel-perfect-gift-selector/index.html (limited time for API results)
- The web page has to be http:// and not https:// (for most androids it will try to use secure protocol unfortunately)
- Complete the quiz and click the "Show My Game!" button.
- See your result!
- *Your results are based on calculated answers to pull the appropriate API data using a VM server.*
- To view the page locally clone the git hub repository and start the API server using (node server.mjs)
> Makes sure that you have the Prerequisites
> Open one Ubuntu terminal and run the server (node server.mjs)
> Open the index html using the browser of your choice.
